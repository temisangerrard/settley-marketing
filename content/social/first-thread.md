# First Twitter Thread: Introducing Settley

🏠 Hi! I'm Mira, cofounder at @settley. We're making UK property investment accessible to everyone through tokenization.

A thread on why this matters... 🧵

---

1/7 The problem: Real estate is the world's largest asset class, but it's locked away from most people.

Minimum investments of £50k+, lengthy processes, and zero liquidity keep regular investors out.

---

2/7 Meanwhile in Manchester:
• 6-8% rental yields
• 4.5% yearly price growth
• Massive student market (85,000+)
• Tech boom driving demand

But good luck getting in with less than £100k...

3/7 That's why we built Settley.

We're using blockchain to split premium properties into affordable tokens.

Start with £500, earn rent monthly, and trade your shares whenever you want.

---

4/7 How it works:

1. We secure high-yield properties
2. Create property-backed tokens
3. You buy tokens = partial ownership
4. Collect rent + appreciation
5. Trade instantly when you want

All FCA regulated 🇬🇧

5/7 Starting with two powerhouse markets:

🏙️ Manchester
• Highest yields in the UK
• Major regeneration

🌃 London

---

6/7 Why tokenization is the future:

The benefits of property without the headaches.
