**Title tag:** Lofty Alternative for European Real Estate Investors | Settley
**Meta description:** Lofty.ai is US-only. Settley provides fractional real estate ownership for UK and European markets. Invest from £100. Earn rental income. Sell anytime.

If you've been researching tokenized real estate, you've probably come across Lofty.ai. It's one of the most established platforms in the space — hundreds of properties, daily rental distributions, a functioning secondary market.

There's just one problem: **Lofty is US-only.**

If you're based in the UK, Europe, or anywhere outside the United States, Lofty won't let you invest. Their properties are US properties, their compliance is US-focused, and their platform isn't built for international investors.

That's the gap Settley fills.

## What Is Lofty.ai?

Lofty.ai is a US-based platform that lets investors buy fractional ownership in US rental properties using blockchain tokens. Properties are tokenized on the Algorand blockchain, rental income is distributed daily, and tokens can be traded on their secondary market.

It's a solid product — for US investors.

**What Lofty offers:**
- 200+ US properties tokenized
- Daily rental income distributions
- Secondary market for token trading
- Minimum investment: $50
- Algorand blockchain

**What Lofty doesn't offer:**
- Access for UK/EU residents (restricted)
- UK or European properties
- MiCA-compliant structure for EU investors
- Properties in markets you actually know

## Why European Investors Need a Lofty Alternative

The US real estate market is attractive, but there are real reasons European investors prefer to invest closer to home:

**1. Currency risk**
Investing in USD-denominated assets from a GBP or EUR base means your returns fluctuate with exchange rates. A 7% yield can become 3% after a bad year for the dollar.

**2. Market familiarity**
You understand London, Manchester, Birmingham. You know which neighbourhoods are growing, which are declining, what a fair rental yield looks like. That knowledge has value.

**3. Regulatory clarity**
The EU's MiCA framework (Markets in Crypto-Assets) is creating clear rules for tokenized assets. UK FCA regulation is evolving similarly. Investing in a platform built for your regulatory environment is lower risk.

**4. Tax simplicity**
Cross-border investment income creates tax complexity. UK rental income from a UK property, held through a UK-compliant structure, is simpler to report.

**5. Access**
Lofty simply doesn't accept UK/EU investors. The decision is made for you.

## Settley: The European Alternative to Lofty

Settley is a property tokenization platform built for UK and European markets. The mechanics are similar to Lofty — fractional ownership, blockchain tokens, rental income — but the focus is entirely different.

**What Settley offers:**
- UK and European properties
- Fractional ownership from £100
- Rental income distributed monthly
- Secondary market for token trading
- SPV structure (legally sound ownership)
- Base blockchain (Ethereum L2 — lower fees, higher security)

## Settley vs Lofty: Side-by-Side Comparison

| Feature | Settley | Lofty.ai |
|---|---|---|
| **Markets** | UK, Europe | US only |
| **Minimum investment** | £100 | $50 |
| **Blockchain** | Base (Ethereum L2) | Algorand |
| **Income distribution** | Monthly | Daily |
| **Secondary market** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **UK/EU investors** | ✅ Accepted | ❌ Restricted |
| **Legal structure** | SPV | LLC |
| **Properties** | UK/EU rental properties | US rental properties |
| **Stage** | Early (growing) | Established (200+ properties) |

**Honest assessment:** Lofty is more mature. They have more properties, more liquidity, and a longer track record. If you're a US investor, Lofty is excellent.

If you're a UK or European investor, Lofty isn't an option — and Settley is built specifically for you.

## How Settley Works

**1. Browse properties**
View verified UK and European rental properties available for fractional investment. Each listing shows projected yield, property details, and token price.

**2. Buy tokens**
Purchase tokens representing fractional ownership in the property. Minimum £100. Each token is an ERC-20 token on Base blockchain, representing a proportional share of the SPV that owns the property.

**3. Earn rental income**
Rental income is collected from tenants and distributed to token holders monthly via smart contract. Automatic, transparent, no chasing payments.

**4. Sell when ready**
Trade your tokens on Settley's secondary market. Unlike traditional real estate, you're not locked in for years — you can exit when you want.

## What You Actually Own

This is important, and it's where a lot of platforms are vague.

When you buy tokens on Settley, you own a fractional share of an SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle). The SPV holds legal title to the property. Your token represents your ownership stake in the SPV.

This means:
- You have real legal ownership, not just a claim
- Your ownership is recorded on-chain (transparent, immutable)
- Rental income flows through the SPV to token holders
- If the property is sold, proceeds are distributed proportionally

It's real estate ownership, made programmable.

- You want exposure to UK/European property markets
- You want to start with a small amount (£100-£1,000)
- You want passive rental income without landlord responsibilities
- You believe in blockchain-based ownership transparency

**Settley might not be right for you if:**

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is Settley regulated?**
Settley operates under applicable UK and EU regulations. Our SPV structures are legally compliant. We're building toward full FCA registration as the regulatory framework for tokenized assets matures.

**What returns can I expect?**
Rental yields vary by property, typically 5-9% annually for UK properties. This is gross yield — net yield after fees is slightly lower. Each property listing shows projected returns.

**What are the fees?**
Settley charges a 2-3% tokenization fee (one-time, paid by property owners) and a 1% annual management fee on AUM. There are no hidden fees for investors.

**Is my investment safe?**
All investments carry risk. Property values can fall, tenants can default, and rental income can fluctuate. Settley mitigates risk through property vetting, legal structuring, and diversification across multiple properties. Never invest more than you can afford to lose.

**Can I invest from any EU country?**
We're expanding EU access progressively. Currently accepting UK investors and select EU markets. Check [settley.co](https://settley.co) for current availability in your country.
