**Title tag:** Settley vs Lofty: Which Tokenized Real Estate Platform is Better? (2026)
**Meta description:** Honest comparison of Settley and Lofty.ai for fractional real estate investing. Markets, fees, legal structure, liquidity, and who should choose each.

---

Tokenized real estate is a small but fast-growing space. Two platforms worth knowing: **Lofty.ai** (the US market leader) and **Settley** (built for UK and European investors).

This is an honest comparison. Not a hit piece on Lofty, not a puff piece for Settley. Both platforms have real strengths. The right choice depends entirely on where you are and what you want.

---

## Quick Summary

**Choose Lofty if:** You're a US investor who wants US properties with a proven track record and 200+ listings.

**Choose Settley if:** You're based in the UK or Europe, want UK/EU properties, and need a platform that actually accepts you.

---

## The Core Difference: Geography

This is the most important factor and it's non-negotiable.

**Lofty.ai** is a US platform. Their properties are in US cities — Detroit, Cleveland, Atlanta, Indianapolis. Their legal structure (Delaware LLCs) is US-based. Their compliance is US-focused. UK and EU investors are restricted from using the platform.

**Settley** is built for UK and European markets. Properties are in the UK and EU. The legal structure uses SPVs (Special Purpose Vehicles) that work within UK/EU regulatory frameworks. UK and EU investors are the primary audience.

If you're in the UK or Europe, this comparison is essentially decided for you. But let's go deeper anyway.

## Platform Comparison

### Properties & Markets

**Lofty:**
- 200+ properties tokenized
- US cities only (Midwest and Sun Belt focus)
- Residential rental properties
- Established inventory with track record

**Settley:**
- Growing inventory of UK and EU properties
- London, Manchester, Birmingham and expanding
- Residential and commercial
- Early stage — fewer properties, but the right markets for EU investors

**Edge:** Lofty has more properties. Settley has the right properties for UK/EU investors.

---

### Minimum Investment

**Lofty:** $50 minimum per property

**Settley:** £100 minimum per property

Both are genuinely accessible. You can build a diversified portfolio with a few hundred pounds/dollars on either platform.

---

### Blockchain & Technology

**Lofty:** Algorand blockchain
- Fast, low-fee transactions
- Less widely adopted than Ethereum ecosystem
- Algorand-specific wallet required

**Settley:** Base blockchain (Ethereum L2)
- Built on Ethereum's security model
- Compatible with MetaMask and major wallets
- Lower fees than Ethereum mainnet
- Larger developer ecosystem

**Edge:** Settley's Base/Ethereum approach has broader ecosystem support. Algorand is solid but more niche.

---

### Income Distribution

**Lofty:** Daily rental income distributions
- Rental income hits your wallet every day
- Psychologically satisfying, practically useful for active traders

**Settley:** Monthly rental income distributions
- Standard for real estate (most landlords collect monthly)
- Simpler accounting and tax reporting

**Edge:** Lofty's daily distributions are a genuine differentiator. Monthly is fine for most investors, but daily is better.

---

### Legal Structure

**Lofty:** Delaware LLC
- Each property held in a separate LLC
- Investors own membership interests
- Well-established US legal framework
- Not designed for non-US investors

**Settley:** SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle)
- Each property held in a separate SPV
- Investors own fractional SPV shares
- Compliant with UK/EU legal frameworks
- Designed for international investors

**Edge:** Depends on your jurisdiction. For UK/EU investors, Settley's SPV structure is more appropriate.

---

### Secondary Market (Liquidity)

**Lofty:** Active secondary market
- Established trading volume
- Real liquidity — you can actually sell
- Price discovery based on supply/demand

**Settley:** Secondary market available
- Earlier stage, building liquidity
- Growing as platform scales

**Edge:** Lofty has more established liquidity. Settley's secondary market is functional but earlier stage.

---

### Fees

**Lofty:**
- No investor fees on primary purchases
- Small transaction fees on secondary market
- Property management fees built into yield calculations

**Settley:**
- No investor fees on primary purchases
- 2-3% tokenization fee (paid by property owners, not investors)
- 1% annual management fee on AUM
- 0.5% secondary market transaction fee

**Edge:** Similar fee structures. Both are reasonable.

## The Honest Take

Lofty is the better-established platform. More properties, more liquidity, longer track record. If you're a US investor, it's hard to argue against Lofty.

But Lofty doesn't serve UK and European investors. That's not a criticism — it's a strategic choice they've made. They're focused on the US market.

Settley exists because that gap is real and large. The UK and EU have hundreds of millions of potential investors who want fractional real estate exposure in their own markets. Settley is building the infrastructure for that.

If you're in the UK or Europe, Settley isn't just an alternative to Lofty — it's the only serious option in your market.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can I use both Settley and Lofty?**
If you're a US investor, yes — you can use Lofty for US properties and Settley for UK/EU exposure (when available). If you're a UK/EU investor, Lofty isn't accessible to you.

**Which platform has better returns?**
Returns depend on the specific property, not the platform. Both platforms target 5-10% annual yields. Compare individual property listings rather than platform averages.

**Is Settley safe?**
Settley uses legally compliant SPV structures and Base blockchain. As with any investment, there are risks — property values can fall, tenants can default. Invest only what you can afford to lose.

**How new is Settley?**
Settley is an early-stage platform, accepted into the CV Labs accelerator in Zug, Switzerland. It's newer than Lofty, which means less track record but also more opportunity to get in early.

**What's the minimum to build a diversified portfolio?**
On Settley, you can spread £500 across 5 properties (£100 each). On Lofty, $250 across 5 properties ($50 each). Both platforms make diversification accessible.
