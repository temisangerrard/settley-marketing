Lofty.ai is one of the best tokenized real estate platforms in the world — if you're a US investor. But if you're outside the US, or you want something different from what Lofty offers, you need alternatives.

This is a ranked list of the best Lofty alternatives in 2026. We've included platforms across different markets, investment styles, and blockchain approaches. We've also included Settley — and we'll be upfront about where it fits.

## Why Look for a Lofty Alternative?

People look for Lofty alternatives for a few reasons:

1. **You're not in the US** — Lofty restricts access to UK and EU investors
2. **You want different markets** — Lofty is US-only; you might want UK, EU, or global exposure
3. **You want a different blockchain** — Lofty uses Algorand; you might prefer Ethereum ecosystem
4. **You want different income timing** — Lofty pays daily; some investors prefer monthly
5. **You want more established platforms** — or conversely, earlier-stage opportunities

Whatever your reason, here are the best alternatives.

## 1. Settley — Best for UK and European Investors

**Website:** settley.co
**Markets:** UK, Europe
**Minimum:** £100
**Blockchain:** Base (Ethereum L2)
**Income:** Monthly

Settley is the most direct Lofty alternative for UK and European investors. It does what Lofty does — fractional property ownership, blockchain tokens, rental income, secondary market — but for UK and EU markets.

**Why it's #1 for EU investors:**
- The only serious tokenized RE platform built for UK/EU markets
- SPV structure compliant with UK/EU regulations
- Ethereum ecosystem (MetaMask compatible, widely understood)
- Early stage = opportunity to get in before the platform scales

**Honest limitations:**
- Fewer properties than Lofty (early stage)
- Less established secondary market liquidity
- Monthly vs daily income distributions

**Best for:** UK and European investors who want fractional real estate in markets they understand.

## 2. RealT — Best for US Properties with Global Access

**Website:** realt.co
**Markets:** US properties, global investors
**Minimum:** ~$50
**Blockchain:** Ethereum, Gnosis Chain
**Income:** Weekly

RealT is one of the original tokenized real estate platforms. They tokenize US rental properties but — unlike Lofty — they accept international investors. If you're outside the US but want US property exposure, RealT is worth considering.

**Why it's #2:**
- Accepts investors from most countries (including UK/EU)
- 300+ properties tokenized
- Weekly rental income distributions
- Ethereum-based (widely compatible)
- Established track record since 2019

**Honest limitations:**
- US properties only (USD currency risk for non-US investors)
- More complex tax situation for international investors
- Higher gas fees on Ethereum mainnet (though Gnosis Chain helps)

**Best for:** International investors who specifically want US property exposure.

## 3. Arrived — Best for Beginners

**Website:** arrived.com
**Markets:** US
**Minimum:** $100
**Blockchain:** None (traditional equity)
**Income:** Quarterly

Arrived (backed by Jeff Bezos) lets you invest in US rental homes and vacation rentals from $100. It's not blockchain-based — it's traditional fractional equity — but it's one of the most user-friendly platforms in the space.

**Why it's #3:**
- Extremely simple interface — no crypto knowledge needed
- $100 minimum
- Both long-term rentals and vacation rentals
- Strong brand and backing
- SEC-qualified offerings

**Honest limitations:**
- US only
- No secondary market (locked until property sells)
- Not blockchain-based (no token trading)
- Quarterly distributions (slower than Lofty)

**Best for:** US investors who want simplicity and don't need liquidity.

## 4. Fundrise — Best for Hands-Off Diversification

**Website:** fundrise.com
**Markets:** US
**Minimum:** $10
**Blockchain:** None (traditional)
**Income:** Quarterly

Fundrise is the largest retail real estate investment platform in the US, with billions in AUM. It's not tokenized — it's a traditional eREIT structure — but it offers broad real estate exposure with very low minimums.

**Why it's #4:**
- $10 minimum (lowest on this list)
- Massive diversification across hundreds of properties
- Professional management
- Long track record
- Multiple fund options (income, growth, balanced)

**Honest limitations:**
- US only
- Limited liquidity (redemption windows, not instant)
- Not blockchain-based
- Less transparent than tokenized platforms
- Quarterly distributions

**Best for:** US investors who want set-it-and-forget-it real estate exposure.

## 5. Fraction — Best for Luxury Properties

**Website:** fraction.re
**Markets:** Global (luxury focus)
**Minimum:** Varies
**Blockchain:** Ethereum
**Income:** Varies

Fraction focuses on high-end properties — luxury homes, premium commercial real estate. If you want exposure to the top end of the market rather than standard rental properties, Fraction is worth exploring.

**Why it's #5:**
- Access to luxury properties normally out of reach
- Global market focus
- Blockchain-based ownership
- Potential for higher appreciation

**Honest limitations:**
- Higher minimums than most platforms
- Less liquidity than established platforms
- Smaller inventory

**Best for:** Investors specifically interested in luxury real estate.

## 6. Roofstock — Best for Full Property Ownership

**Website:** roofstock.com
**Markets:** US
**Minimum:** Full property price
**Blockchain:** None
**Income:** Monthly (rental)

Roofstock is different from the others — it's a marketplace for buying full rental properties, not fractions. But it's worth including because many people searching for Lofty alternatives are actually looking for a better way to invest in rental properties generally.

**Why it's #6:**
- Vetted rental properties with tenant data
- Full ownership (not fractional)
- Professional property management available
- Strong track record

**Honest limitations:**
- Full property prices (not fractional)
- US only
- Requires significant capital
- Not blockchain-based

**Best for:** Investors ready to buy full rental properties in the US.

## 7. Lofty.ai — The Original (For US Investors)

**Website:** lofty.ai
**Markets:** US
**Minimum:** $50
**Blockchain:** Algorand
**Income:** Daily

Yes, Lofty is on its own alternatives list. If you're a US investor who hasn't tried Lofty yet, it belongs on your radar. It's the most established tokenized real estate platform in the US.

**Why it's #7 (on an alternatives list):**
- 200+ properties
- Daily income distributions
- Active secondary market
- Proven track record

**Why it might not be right for you:**
- US investors only
- Algorand blockchain (less mainstream)
- US properties only

**Best for:** US investors who want the most established tokenized RE platform.

## Comparison Table

| Platform | Markets | Min. | Blockchain | Income | Liquidity |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Settley** | UK, EU | £100 | Base (ETH L2) | Monthly | Secondary market |
| **RealT** | US (global investors) | ~$50 | Ethereum | Weekly | Secondary market |

## How to Choose

**If you're in the UK or Europe:** Settley is your primary option. RealT works if you want US exposure despite the currency risk.

**If you're in the US and want tokenized RE:** Lofty is the benchmark. RealT is a solid alternative with more international focus.

**If you're in the US and don't care about blockchain:** Arrived (simple, beginner-friendly) or Fundrise (maximum diversification, lowest minimum).

**If you want luxury properties:** Fraction.

**If you want to buy full properties:** Roofstock.

---

## The Bottom Line

Lofty is excellent — for US investors. The rest of the world needs alternatives, and the options are growing.

For UK and European investors specifically, Settley is the most relevant platform. It's earlier stage than Lofty, but it's built for your market, your regulations, and your currency.

The tokenized real estate space is still early. Getting in now — on any of these platforms — means you're ahead of the mainstream adoption curve.
