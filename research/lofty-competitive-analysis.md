# Lofty.ai Competitive Deep Dive
**Research Date:** 2026-02-20
**Purpose:** Identify positioning gaps for Settley's UK unlock strategy

## Key Findings

### Geography Gap (Our Biggest Opportunity)
- **Lofty is US-only**: Every property is US-based, US investors only
- **No international expansion**: No mention of UK/EU markets anywhere
- **Regulatory focus**: Only has US accreditations
- **Settley angle**: "Real estate tokenization for the UK market"

### Investment Mechanics Differences
**Lofty's approach:**
- Minimum: $50-$90 per property
- Algorand blockchain (not Ethereum like us)
- Daily rental distributions (we do monthly)
- They handle property management (we keep owner control)
- 2.5% fee structure (similar to our 2-3%)

### Property Types & Focus
**Current:**
- 240+ properties (higher than we thought)
- Price range: $80-$200 per token
- Focus on single-family homes, mostly B/C class neighborhoods
- Locations: Atlanta, Tampa, Chicago, Charlotte
- Target: Rent yields 6-12%

### Educational Content Analysis
**High-performing topics:**
- "What is rental yield?"
- "How to build real estate wealth"
- "Fractional ownership explained"
- "Diversification strategies"

**Content gaps we can exploit:**
- No UK-specific tax advice
- Nothing about international investors
- No SPV/legal structure explanations
- Missing "what you actually own" clarity

### Marketing Landing Pages to Create
**Immediate priorities:**
1. "Lofty Alternative for UK Investors" 
2. "Real estate tokenization UK vs USA"
3. "Invest in British property from £100"
4. "UK property ownership vs US fractional platforms"

### SEO Weaknesses Identified
**Lofty doesn't rank for:**
- "tokenised real estate UK" (700 monthly searches)
- "property investment UK small amounts"
- "British real estate tokens"
- "UK fractional property ownership"

## Action Plan
1. **Create UK-focused landing page** (today)
2. **Write "Lofty UK Alternative" comparison** 
3. **Target "UK property tokenization" long-tail keywords**
4. **Position Settley as "Ethereum-based, UK-first" platform**
