## 🎯 Mission

Infrastructure for onchain property ownership - enabling buying and selling homes in minutes through tokenization.

**Tagline:** "Real Ownership. Real Assets. Real Simple."

---

## 💡 Product

### What Settley Does
Property tokenization platform enabling fractional real estate ownership through:
- SPVs (Special Purpose Vehicles)
- Delaware LLCs
- DAOs
- Smart contracts on Base (Ethereum L2)

### Value Proposition

**For Buyers (Investors):**
- Buy fractions of rental properties from $100
- Earn passive rental income
- Diversify across multiple properties
- Sell anytime (liquid vs traditional RE)

**For Sellers (Property Owners):**
- Unlock 30-100% of property equity
- Keep rental income on retained %
- Maintain property control
- No 6% realtor fees
- 2-4 week timeline vs 3-6 months

### How It Works

**Infrastructure model** (not marketplace):
1. Property → SPV creation
2. SPV → Tokenization (ERC-20)
3. Tokens → Sold to investors
4. Rental income → Distributed via smart contracts
5. Compliance layer → KYC/AML built-in

## 💭 Key Strategic Decisions

### Two-Sided Marketplace
- **Buyers:** Investors seeking fractional RE ownership
- **Sellers:** Property owners seeking liquidity
- Current website optimized for buyers only
- **Missing:** Seller landing page (critical gap)

### Geographic Strategy
- Spain first (current pipeline)
- BUT: US might be easier legally (SPV transfers)
- Need to decide and commit to ONE market for next 6 months

### Growth Constraints
- ❌ No paid ad budget
- ✅ Must grow 100% organically
- ✅ Need both buyer AND seller acquisition equally
- ✅ Developer available for implementation

---

## 🎯 Immediate Marketing Priorities

1. **Build seller landing page** (doesn't exist)
2. **Penetrate UK/US markets** (current users in Nigeria)
3. **Compete with Lofty** (capture their overflow/EU traffic)
4. **Two-sided growth** (buyers + sellers equally)
5. **Zero budget constraint** (no paid ads allowed)

**This context feeds all marketing strategy and execution.**
